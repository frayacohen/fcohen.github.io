    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>I have a passion for software and hardware development, and I've been engaged in chip development for over 20 years.  
       I'm a Verification Manager at Cirrus Logic and actively involved in tools and methodologies across the product development cycle.  
        Before joining Cirrus I worked as a Verification Consultant with Synopsys for over 6 years working directly with client companies
        on-site and architecting solutions for their regression management flows and coverage closure utilities.  I also wrote testbench
        code, performed peer code reviews, and assisted in ramping up junior verification engineers.
